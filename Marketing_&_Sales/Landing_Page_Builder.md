## Intro

This project is excellent for learning how to create drag-and-drop interfaces, responsive design, and integrating various technologies. By the end, you'll be adept at creating tools that simplify website creation, making you a stronger candidate for tech roles.

## Details

Create a tool that enables users to design custom landing pages without coding. The app should allow for dragging and dropping of elements, style customization, and viewing changes in real-time.

### User Stories:

1.  **Drag and Drop:** Users can select elements like text boxes, images, and buttons and place them anywhere on the page.
2.  **Templates:** Users can start with a pre-built template and modify it to suit their needs.
3.  **Custom Styles:** Users can change the colors, fonts, and layouts to make the page look exactly how they want.
4.  **Preview Mode:** Users can switch to a preview mode to see how their page will look on different devices.
5.  **Integration:** The tool integrates with email marketing services to collect visitor information.
6.  **Forms:** Users can add forms to their pages to gather leads.
7.  **Export Options:** After designing, users can export the complete HTML and CSS for their custom landing page.

## Design

Use tools like Relume to structure your app and create initial wireframes. This will help you visualize the user interface and plan the user experience effectively.

## Backend APIs

To improve your backend skills, set up your own backend using Supabase. This includes handling user authentication, data storage, and custom APIs for your features. If its too complex for you, create mock APIs to simulate backend interactions.
