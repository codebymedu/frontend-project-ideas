## Intro

This challenge is perfect for learning about user behavior analysis and making data-driven decisions in web development. You'll gain hands-on experience with A/B testing frameworks and user engagement metrics, crucial for optimizing web applications.

## Complexity Level

- **Very High**: Master complex layers and dimensions ðŸ”µ

## Details

This project is designed for developers interested in creating tools to run A/B tests on websites. By the end of this challenge, you'll be able to build a custom A/B testing platform that lets users conduct experiments to compare different versions of their web pages. This is a great way to understand how small changes can impact user behavior and improve website performance.

### User Stories:

1.  **Experiment Setup:** Users can create and manage multiple experiments, defining the variations of the page to be tested.
2.  **User Segmentation:** Users can segment their audience based on demographics, device usage, and user behavior to target specific groups.
3.  **Real-time Data:** Users can view real-time data on how different versions perform in terms of clicks, conversions, and other customizable metrics.
4.  **Results Analysis:** Users can analyze the results with built-in statistical tools to determine which version outperforms the others significantly.
5.  **Integration:** The tool integrates seamlessly with existing web platforms like WordPress or custom-built websites.
6.  **Dashboard:** Users have access to a dashboard where they can see all active experiments and historical data analysis.
7.  **Feedback Collection:** Users can collect qualitative feedback from selected users to gain deeper insights into the user experience.

## Design

Use tools like Relume to structure your app and create initial wireframes. This will help you visualize the user interface and plan the user experience effectively.

## Backend APIs

To improve your backend skills, set up your own backend using Supabase. This includes handling user authentication, data storage, and custom APIs for your features. If its too complex for you, create mock APIs to simulate backend interactions.
